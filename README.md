*A lightweight GUI framework for embedded displays*

This branch adds my custom elements:

XBusyWait:  A Microsoft like wait with Dots running in a circle motion.
ex45_ard_busywait shows usage.

XCombobox:  A combination of Text Field with a hidden drop-down listbox for options.
ex48_ard_combobox shows usage

Upgrade to Keypads.
First you no longer need to use compound elements saving about 1500kb of Ram.
The Number keypad now allows you set on a per field basis to be either float or integer number.
The Alpha keypad is now smaller and has buttons to switch to either a number or special symbols keypad.
No code changes are required to use these keypads.
